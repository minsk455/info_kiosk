The cases related to transportation and (or) accommodation, where confirmation of this agreement is considered to be a ticket or a document to check into the accommodation facility (voucher, etc.) are exceptions.

             <p><span style="font-size:16.0pt; line-height: 1.3;">Given the fact that many travel companies provide tourists with visa support, we draw attention to the fact that, within the meaning of The provision of tourist services Rules, the contractor upon receiving the required documents for the visa (visas) obtaining to the country (place) of temporary residence (transit travel), if necessary, consults on issues of paperwork, as well as warns about reasons that may result in refusal to open a visa(s).</span></p>
